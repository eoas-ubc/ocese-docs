# OCESE documentation collection

```{note}
Note to self: Grow the book based on [Jupyterbook docs](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) not someone else's precedent.
```
This book will contain concise guidelines for topics listed below and in the menu.

```{note}
The intention is to include lists and concise summaries, not explanations of philosophy.
```
