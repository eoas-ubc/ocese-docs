# OCESE documentation collection

This is documentation for the resources and practices being build as part of the **Opensource Computing for Earth Science Education** project, a large TLEF-funded [project](https://tlef.ubc.ca/funded-proposals/entry/714/?login) in the Department of Earth Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences ([EOAS](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/)) at University of British Columbia ([UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/))

```{note}
Note to self: Grow the book based on [Jupyterbook docs](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) not someone else's precedent.
```
This book will contain concise guidelines for topics listed below and in the menu.

```{note}
The intention is to include lists and concise summaries, not explanations of philosophy.
```

Our [website](https://eoas-ubc.github.io/) is a good place for an outline of the project.

## Topics

- Basics, including command line use, "environments", Markdown and text editing.
- Git, GitHub and corresponding procedures and guidelines
- Jupyter, Jupyter notebooks, Jupytext, Jupyterbook, and the like.
