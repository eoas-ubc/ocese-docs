# Git and GitHub

This chapter would include documentation on:

- Git
- GitHub
- Related procedures and guidelines.

## Pointers

There are a great many open-source and commercial tutorials, how-to's and manuals including written pages, tutorials (with exercises, examples etc.), and videos. Here are some open-source recommendations:

|Description|Type|Comments|
|---|---|---|
|**[7-part intro. to Git](https://www.neonscience.org/version-control-git-series)** from NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network).|written tutorial website|Succinct, no extra words, includes objectives; very nice. Somewhat derived from Software Carpentry (next item). Includes updating repos via "remote".|
|**[Software carpentry's resources](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)** for their hands on workshops.|Well organized website|Includes a workshop schedule, pages for each section & exercises. A bit more wordy than NEON's introduction, but well designed and tested.|
|**[Git manual](https://git-scm.com/doc)** and others, from Git.|Ref. manual; book; videos|Detailed documentation and the comprehensive Pro Git book. Four short videos are good introductions.|
|**[Git cheat sheet](https://www.jrebel.com/system/files/git-cheat-sheet.pdf)**|PDF page|From a nice (although oldish, 2016) summary by _Rebellabs_ called [Git Cheat Sheet: Commands and Best Practices](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet).|

NOTE: At UBC, faculty and staff can also use linkedIn Learning "courses". Start at https://linkedinlearning.ubc.ca, log in using your CWL and search for Git, or GitHub, etc. There are many, but at least they are not quite as random as the unfiltered internet.

## Conclusion

There are so many resources out there that it is daunting to find just the right level. Hopefully these suggestions will he helpful.
