# OCESE - Open-source Computing for Earth Science Education

This website is about our ongoing project (2020 through 2023) to transform teaching in the [UBC Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca) (EOAS) to use open source tools, particularly [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.jupyter.org) organized as [executable books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/)

**Formal title:** Embedding Open-source Computational Tools into the Quantitative Earth Science Specializations

**Project funding:** [The UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund](https://tlef.ubc.ca/funded-proposals/entry/714/), and internal support from the Department - EOAS.
